# Setting up your server

In order to run mit-tab for your tournament, it has to be accessible to all of
your competitors on the internet. The
[MIT-Tab Deploy application](https://github.com/benmusch/mit-tab) handles that
process.

To set up a tournament, visit
[nu-tab.com/tournaments/new](https://nu-tab.com/tournaments/new). The form is
pretty self-explanatory. You'll receive an email once the initialization
process is completed.

If you want to be able to test out mit-tab on a separate server with fake data,
you can check the `Include Test Tournament?` box, and you'll get a server at
`[tournament name]-test.nu-tab.com`. The login will be `tab` as the username
and `password` as the password. This is a great way to test how to enter
scratches, pair a round, etc.

**NOTE:** Due to how the tournaments are set up, using quote characters
(`'` or `"`) in your password may cause a bug. Keep it simple.
